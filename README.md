# Memory Game

[LIVE DEMO](https://react-game-bh7vbo394-eugeniybondarenko-gmailcom.vercel.app/) 
## Rules
- choose a card
- choose another card
- if they match you get 2 scores
- if don't - you lose 1 life
- make nother turn
- if you guessed all cards -> you won
- if you don't have any lifes left -> you lost

The player then selects another card and turns it over. If the two cards are a matching pair for example two Jacks then they take the two cards and start a stack. The player is awarded another turn for making a match and goes again.

## Used technologies:
- HTML
- CSS (CSS in JS - [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.6.0) Libarary)
- Material UI
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

Also, I used css flexbox for responsive layout.
